## Overview

### Description

Taking in information about employees on a software engineering team and generating an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.


### Installation

Because this is a Node.js application that runs from a machine and not a browser, it can't be deployed to GitHub pages. If anyone ever wants to look at the application, you have to clone it to your own local machine and run it from there.


### Usage

The application will be invoked by using the following command: node index.js

### Tests

Clone it to your own local machine and enter node index.js in command line.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- enter any information about team's members based on the questions.

## My process

### Built with

- JavaScript

### What I learned

- setting test file

To see how I add code snippets, see below:

```JS
test('creates a employee object', () => {
    const employee = new Employee('Joey', 1, '123@gmail.com');

    expect(employee.name).toBe('Joey');
    expect(employee.id).toEqual(expect.any(Number));
    expect(employee.email).toEqual(expect.any(String));
})

```
